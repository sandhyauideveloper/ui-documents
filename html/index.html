			<h2 id="heading2">What do you mean by YOGA?</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India. The
				word, yoga, comes from the Sanskrit <b>yuj</b>, which means <b>“to yoke”</b> and <b>"samadhi"</b> or
				<b>"concentration."</b> Thus, <b>yoga is the practice that aims to join the mind, body and spirit.</b>
				The ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve liberation.</p>
			<div class="limbs">
				<h2>What are the eight "Limbs of YOGA"?</h2>
				The name “8 Limbs” comes from the Sanskrit term Ashtanga and refers to the eight limbs of yoga: <br>
				<b>Yama </b>(attitudes toward our environment),<br>
				<b>Niyama </b>(attitudes toward ourselves), <br>
				<b>Asana</b> (physical postures), <br>
				<b>Pranayama </b>(restraint or expansion of the breath), <br>
				<b>Pratyahara </b>(withdrawal of the senses),<br>
				<b>Dharana</b> (concentration)<br>
				<b>Dhyana</b> (meditation) and<br>
				<b> Samadhi</b> (complete integration)
			</div>
			<h2 id="heading2">Benefits Of YOGA</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Yoga’s benefits affect each person in a different way. Many find that it helps them to
				relax; others find themselves feeling healthier and more energetic. All the systems in the body-from the
				lymphatic to the digestive to the cardiovascular-benefit from yoga. <b>Yoga benefits every aspect of our
					bodies, inside and out.</b></p>
			<p class="paragraph">On the inside, yoga enables relaxation. Many practitioners find that yoga helps them to
				<b>focus and feel relaxed in both work and play</b>. In 2003, scientists studied both long-time yogis
				and beginners; they found that the stress hormone cortisol had decreased, even after just one session of
				yoga. Yoga has also been found to increase alpha and theta waves in the brain, meaning that yoga can
				relax the brain and increase access to the subconscious and emotions. And by simply increasing the
				feel-good brain chemicals like endorphins, enkephalins, and serotonin, yoga practitioners just feel
				better.</p>

		<h2 id="benefits">Benefits Of YOGA</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">Yoga’s benefits affect each person in a different way. Many find that it helps them to
			relax; others find themselves feeling healthier and more energetic. All the systems in the body-from the
			lymphatic to the digestive to the cardiovascular-benefit from yoga. <b>Yoga benefits every aspect of our
			bodies, inside and out.</b></p>
		<p class="paragraph">On the inside, yoga enables relaxation. Many practitioners find that yoga helps them to <b>focus and feel relaxed in both work and play</b>. In 2003, scientists studied both long-time yogis
			and beginners; they found that the stress hormone cortisol had decreased, even after just one session of
			yoga. Yoga has also been found to increase alpha and theta waves in the brain, meaning that yoga can
			relax the brain and increase access to the subconscious and emotions. And by simply increasing the
			feel-good brain chemicals like endorphins, enkephalins, and serotonin, yoga practitioners just feel
			better.</p>
